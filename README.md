## üóÇÔ∏è API Backend

This API source code is part of the **[Pardre Genos](https://github.com/ahmad-bradii/padre_Genos)** project, providing backend functionality for managing pizza-related operations. .

The API provides RESTful endpoints to manage pizza menu items, process customer orders, and handle contact form submissions. It leverages Fastify for high performance and uses SQLite as its database engine, ensuring lightweight and efficient data storage. The endpoints support typical CRUD operations, allowing clients to create, read, update, and delete pizzas and orders, as well as submit and retrieve contact messages.

**To run the API locally:**

```sh
cd api
npm install
npm start
```
